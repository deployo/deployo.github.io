      <description>Recently I deployed and app to Heroku and I wanted to force my users to only access it over HTTPS. I tried finding a configuration option in the Heroku dashboard but found nothing, then I stumbeled upon this help page and the following sentence: &amp;ldquo;Redirects need to be performed at the application level as the Heroku router does not provide this functionality. You should code the redirect logic into your application&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Dokku is a wonderfull tool if you want to run you own Heroku-like platform where you can host a number of your applications. It helps you set up your deployment, database connection, nginx configuration and even SSL with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt.
Dokku makes runing your application and connecting it to a database very easy, but what if you have multiple applications that need to talk to each other?
Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you have an application and a database.</description>

      <description>Dokku is a Heroku-like &amp;ldquo;docker-powered PaaS that helps you build and manage the lifecycle of applications&amp;rdquo;, as it says on its GitHub page. It has a similar git-centric interface for running and managing your applications.
I will show you how to install and use Dokku on a Linode instance. I will be using Deployo to manage the server but you can also just SSH into the server and execute the same commands.</description>

      <description>The configuration page is the main place where you set up your servers and scripts. The entire configuration iss a YAML file where you can configure everything that you need.
YAML A basic YAML configuration file would looks something like this:
servers: - name: production host: prod.deployo.me port: 22 user: root password: root environment: ENV_VAR: var1 scripts: - name: echo_variable commands: - echo &amp;quot;command&amp;quot; - echo $ENV_VAR variables: - ENV_VAR2 environment: ENV_VAR3: var3 workdir: /tmp templates: - name: deploy_prod description: Deploy to production servers: - production scripts: - echo_variable variables: ENV_VAR2: value cronjobs: - schedule: &#39;* * * * *&#39; servers: - production scripts: - echo_variable variables: ENV_VAR2: value notifyOnFailed: email: - notification@email.</description>

      <description>The dashboard shows all your available servers and recent history.
Servers Every time the dashboard is loaded Deployo will try to ping all of your servers. If it succeds the server will be marked with a label connected in case pinging fails the server will be marked with unreachable.
Hovering over an unreachable label will give you more information about the error.
History The history displays the latest executions.</description>

      <description>Executing scripts When you run a script you will be prompted for any user input configured for the sctript you are running that will manifest itself as an environment variale. After you enter everything you need Deployo will SSH into the chosen server export all environment variables and run the selected script.
You will be able to follow the execution as Deployo directly streams output from your servers using websockets.</description>
