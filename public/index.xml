      <title>Force HTTPS on Heroku</title>

      <description>Recently I deployed an app to Heroku and I wanted to force my users to only access it over HTTPS. I tried finding a configuration option in the Heroku dashboard but found nothing, then I stumbled upon this help page and the following sentence: &amp;ldquo;Redirects need to be performed at the application level as the Heroku router does not provide this functionality. You should code the redirect logic into your application&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Dokku is a wonderfull tool if you want to run you own Heroku-like platform where you can host a number of your applications. It helps you set up your deployment, database connection, nginx configuration and even SSL with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt.
Dokku makes runing your application and connecting it to a database very easy, but what if you have multiple applications that need to talk to each other?
Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you have an application and a database.</description>

      <description>Dokku is a Heroku-like &amp;ldquo;docker-powered PaaS that helps you build and manage the lifecycle of applications&amp;rdquo;, as it says on its GitHub page. It has a similar git-centric interface for running and managing your applications.
I will show you how to install and use Dokku on a Linode instance. I will be using Deployo to manage the server but you can also just SSH into the server and execute the same commands.</description>

      <description>The configuration page is the main place where you set up your servers and scripts. The entire configuration is a YAML file where you can configure everything that you need.
A YAML configuration file looks something like this:
servers: - name: production host: prod.deployo.me port: 22 user: root password: root environment: ENV_VAR: var1 scripts: - name: echo_variable commands: - echo &amp;quot;command&amp;quot; - echo $ENV_VAR variables: - ENV_VAR2 environment: ENV_VAR3: var3 workdir: /tmp templates: - name: deploy_prod description: Deploy to production servers: - production scripts: - echo_variable variables: ENV_VAR2: value cronjobs: - schedule: &#39;* * * * *&#39; servers: - production scripts: - echo_variable variables: ENV_VAR2: value notifyOnFailed: email: - notification@email.</description>

      <description>The dashboard shows all your available servers and recent history. From here you can execute configured or predefined scripts adn templates. You are able to execute multiple scripts on multiple servers.
If you are executing on multiple servers at the same time the execution will be done in parallel.
If you are executing multiple scripts at the same time, they will be execute sequentially in order they were selected.</description>

      <description>Executing scripts When you run a script you will be prompted for any user input configured for the sctript you are running that will manifest itself as an environment variale. If multiple scripts exepect a variable with the same name, the variable value will be shared between them.
After you enter everything you need Deployo will SSH into the chosen server export all environment variables and run the selected script.</description>

      <description>The Projects page allows you to create projects and add collaborators. For every project you have a separate configuration file with servers, scripts, templates, cronjobs belonging just to that project.
Depending on your plan you can invite a certain number of collaboratiors on a project.
All collaborators have have the same configuration editing and execution rights, but a collaborator cannot delete the project.
Inviting collaborators The owner of a project can invite anyone to join.</description>

      <guid>https://deployo.me/docs/ssh_keys/</guid>
      <description>SSH keys allow you to connect to your server without using a password. If an SSH key is not configured the password will be used.
In case both a password and an SSH keys have been configured the password will be used first.
On this page you have a preview of all the keys stored by Deployo. You can see SSH keys connected to a server or keys that are not connected to any servers anymore.</description>

      <description>This is a safe way to store sensitive data. Every project has its own dedicated set of secrets that can be used in the configuration file.
All secrets have the same prefix (SECRET_) and can be referenced in the commands section of the scripts and as a password for a server.
Secrets will never be exposed in logs or in the execution output of deploys.
Any collaborator can toggle secret visibility in the UI.</description>
